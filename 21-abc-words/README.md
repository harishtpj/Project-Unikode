# 21. The `ABC Words` problem
A word is an ABC word if the letters "a", "b" and "c" appear in the word in alphabetical order.

If any or all of these letters occur more than once in a word, then only the first occurrence of each letter should be used to determine whether a word is an  ABC word  or not.

The Task is to find all ABC words and print it on the screen along the no of such words found out of total no of words.

This problem is taken from collection [3](https://github.com/harishtpj/Project-Unikode/blob/master/README.md#%E2%84%B9-about)
