# 31. The `Even Fibonacci sum` problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


This problem is taken from collection [4](https://github.com/harishtpj/Project-Unikode/blob/master/README.md#%E2%84%B9-about)
