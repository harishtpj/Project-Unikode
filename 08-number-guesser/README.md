# 8. The `Number Guesser` game
The `Number Guesser` game generates a random number between 1 to 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. It also counts the guesses made and also considers the same guess as multiple input as one guess

This problem is taken from collection [1](https://github.com/harishtpj/Project-Unikode/blob/master/README.md#%E2%84%B9-about)
