# 29. The `Levenshtein Distance` task
In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the amount of difference between two sequences (i.e. an edit distance). The Levenshtein distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

Implements a Levenshtein distance function, or uses a library function, to show the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting".
